      <h1>The project</h1>
      <p>
        This project was created as a collaboration of friends from the Hivecom community and the dedicated development
        team called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mavulp">Mavulp</a>. The goal of hi!friends is to create
        a centralized hub to share images of mostly real life gatherings, events and adventures we embark on together.

        <br>
        <br>

        Given the fact that we - the community behind Hivecom and it's further groups of friends - all grew up in
        different parts of the world and in the course of over 10 years found together through our shared interests,
        goals and quite simply bizarre circumstances; these albums can hold a lot of sentimental value that can only be
        described as a family bond.

        <br>
        <br>
        We'd like to share this bond between all of us, and all of you who might one day be a part of that too. In the
        meantime: we also do a lot of gaming together, want to join? Check out our site!
